Notes
-----

```console
gpg: Generating a GPG key, might take a while

Not enough random bytes available.  Please do some other work to give
the OS a chance to collect more entropy! (Need 282 more bytes)
```

At the first start this is normal. Generate entropy on the host system, e.g. by using find, ping, or [haveged](http://www.issihosts.com/haveged/).
